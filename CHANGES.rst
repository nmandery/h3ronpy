Changelog
=========

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is loosely based on `Keep a
Changelog <https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/>`__, and this project
adheres to `Semantic
Versioning <https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html>`__.


Unreleased
----------

- Improved documentation of the raster modules.
- Validate bounds of input raster arrays to be within WGS84 lat/lon coordinates.


0.17.0 - 2023-06-27
-------------------

In this release the project migrated to the `arrow memory model <https://arrow.apache.org/>`_ and switched
from the `h3ron library <https://github.com/nmandery/h3ron>`_ to the Rust implementation of H3 named `h3o <https://github.com/HydroniumLabs/h3o>`_.
This comes along with safer code and `performance improvements <https://github.com/nmandery/rasterh3/issues/1>`_. Although `h3ronpy` is no longer
build on the `h3ron` rust crate, the name remains.

As a result of these migrations, the Python API has completely changed. Due to this it is easier to refer to new
new documentation than listing the changes here. That is another aspect of these changes - there now exists a sphinx generated
documentation.

Other changes:

-  Upgrade from pyo3 0.18 to 0.19.

0.16.1 - 2023-02-16
-------------------

-  Upgrade from pyo3 0.17 to 0.18.
-  Support minimum supported python version to 3.7 again

0.16.0 - 2022-12-28
--------------------

-  Directly support GeoSeries in vector to H3 conversion by
   automatically exchanging geometries using WKB.
   `#7 <https://github.com/nmandery/h3ronpy/pull/7>`__
-  Raise minimum supported python version to 3.8.
-  ``intersecting`` argument for ``geodataframe_to_h3`` to also include
   cells which are only intersecting with the geometry, but whose
   centroid is not contained in the geometry.

0.15.1 - 2022-10-28
-------------------

-  Upgrade to h3ron v0.16.0.

      follow H3 conventions:

      -  In ``h3ronpy.op`` module:

         -  ``kring_distances`` -> ``grid_disk_distances``
         -  ``kring_distances_agg`` -> ``grid_disk_distances_agg``
         -  ``kring_distances_agg_np`` -> ``grid_disk_distances_agg_np``

-  Replace usage of ``wkb`` crate with ``geozero`` because of licensing.
-  Stop supporting Python 3.6 (was EOL on 23 Dec 2021). Minimum
   supported python version now is Python 3.7.
-  Omit empty geometries when converting vector data.
-  Dependency upgrades.
